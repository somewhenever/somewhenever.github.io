<div style="text-align: center;"><h3><a href="https://vfringe.co.uk/events/dark-tales-from-the-woods/">DANIEL MORDEN — DARK TALES FROM THE WOODS</a></h3>
<p><a href=""><img width="50%" src="images/dan_morden_face.jpg" /></a></p></div>

__A hundred years ago the famous Welsh gypsy family the Woods told wild fairy tales around the fire- tales of shapeshifting and magic and drama and danger.__

Now, award-winning storyteller DANIEL MORDEN retells those thrilling tales with wit, passion and gusto.

In 2017 Daniel was awarded the Hay Festival Medal for his services to storytelling.

_“Gruesome, fantastical and hypnotic, Morden’s stories show why fairytales will never lose their power over our imaginations.” – `The Times`_

*This performance of 'Dark Tales from the Woods' is promoted by the Island Storytellers as part of __Somewhen__, a year-long celebration of storytelling, funded by an Arts Council National Lottery Project Grant.*
