*Somewhenever* is a year long series of storytelling events taking place somewhen throughout 2023 on the beautiful island of the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England.

__*Tellers, not readers.* Spoken, not read. *Not (just) for children.*__

<h2>OVER FOR ANOTHER YEAR — SOMEWHEN EVENTS AT VENTNOR FRINGE, 2023</h2>

<p>Giants, green dragons, wonder tales, sock hunts... The Island Storyteller's Somewhen team  brought a myriad of stories to Ventnor Fringe last week in a multitude of events. Internationally renowned storyteller Xanthe Gresham Knight enthralled the audience with her tales chosen by the audience; Xanthe had stepped in at the last moment as well-known storyteller, Daniel Morden, had been taken ill. Sue Bailey said, "It was great that Xanthe was able to come. We were looking for someone of a similar calibre to Daniel, and Xanthe pulled the stops out to fill the void with mesmerising stories and accordion playing".</p>

<p>Tony ‘Monty' Hirst hot-footed from a pop-up Somewhen Storytelling set at Calbourn Watermill's *Arthurian Weekend* to open up the feast of Somewhen storytelling events at the Fringe with another outing of 'Unforeseen Consequences', his set of slightly nonsensical tales where the outcome is not always expected! He said "The fringe is a fantastic opportunity for bringing traditional stories to new audiences. Storytelling was the standup of its day, and many of the tales work as well today as ever they did."</p>

<p>On the Wednesday midway through Fringe week, seven regulars people, from the Island Storytellers' monthly story round, took to the floor to tell tales linked by the word green. Sue continued "I loved the diversity of voices and styles at our ‘Green' storytelling at Ventnor Library. It really showed that stories come in many forms whether they are based on anecdotes, traditional folk tales  or even on impossibly probable animal stories. We rocked with laughter when local storyteller Sue Clark related  her story of how their caravanning group converted a car into a green dragon."</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/sue-clarke-vf-2023-small.jpg" width="60%" style="border:10px" /></div>

<p>Stories continued on the final Friday, when <a href="https://tistales.org.uk/">TisTales</a>, a trio of local storytellers, regaled a packed audience at Ventnor Arts Club with tales of giants.  Holly Medland's tales of the origin of Britain gave a possible insight into the assertive nature of women on these islands today, as the heroine, Albina, encouraged the daughters of a Syrian king to rise up against the mundane and devaluing requirements of being obedient and subservient wives.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/holly-vf-2023-small.jpg" width="60%" style="border:10px" /></div>

<p>Welsh hero, Bendigeidfran ("Bran the Blessed"), Irish giant, Fionn mac Cumhail and Norse god, Thor, also featured in this excellent hour of stories.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/sw_banner_arts_club_vf_2023.jpg" width="60%" style="border:10px" /></div>

<p>On Saturday and Sunday Sue Bailey led one of her infamous and highly engaging storywalks. "One sock – a riddle and story filled sock hunt, is such fun"  said Sue. "The children are very sharp eyed and always manage to follow the clues and find all my missing socks. I love the way they work together and even though they are keen to be the finders, they make sure all the children taking part have a chance to find something".</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/sue-socks-walk-vf-2023.jpg" width="60%" style="border:10px" /></div>

<p>As wll as ticketed performances, stories were also told as part of several free fringe sets in the Fringe Square.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/sw_banner_fringe_sq_vf_2023.jpg" width="60%" style="border:10px" /></div>

<p>Sue Bailey continued "It has been great being part of Ventnor Fringe.  We are very grateful to the organisers for providing a platform for all the performances,  whether they be local, national or international. Our storytelling events this week have been part of a year long lottery supported project called ‘Somewhen Storytelling'.</p>

The three Island storytellers, Holly Medland, Monty (Tony) Hirst and Sue Bailey, that comprise [*'Tis Tales*](https://tistales.org.uk/), tell larger than life stories about larger than life characters.

Trolls, ogres, giants and gargantuan monsters, – all have a nightmarish place in the human psyche. Come and hear how the mighty are overcome in tales, of foolishness and bravery, from near and far flung lands.

The storytelling trio's success at last year's Fringe helped kick start the Isle of Wight's very own Somewhen Storytelling Festival, which took place in June this year.

Don't miss their fresh and enthusiastic renditions of these tales. The stories may have been first told once upon a somewhenever, somewherever, a very long time ago… but be assured , these tales will stay with you long after the last word is spoken.

</div>

Date / time: Wednesday 26 July 2023, 7:30 pm - 9:30 pm  
Ventnor Library  

GREEN is life itself. From the smallest flower to the oldest oak; flashing eyes of love to the dark plots of jealous envy; ‘The force through the green fuse drives the flower...'. And don't forget lizards, parrots and dragons with their GREEN Scales and Tails. Come to hear GREEN stories of every description as told by the Island Storytellers.

The simple art of storytelling has been with us forever, enjoyed by young and old alike, in all parts of the world. Come join us to hear a mix of tales linked together by the colour green, and brought to you by The Island Storytellers, a group of people who meet monthly, keen to keep alive the age old art of oral storytelling and share the pleasure of listening and telling.

This evening of tales will be great for adults and older children. A cosy atmosphere with (green!) refreshments in the break.

*Storytelling as living oral culture. Tales for all ages, spoken not read. Because stories aren't (just) for children.*

How many odd socks are there in your house? In Sue-the-storyteller's house there seem to be dozens. She's on the hunt for some pairs.

Can you help her find them?

You'll need sharp eyes and keen ears as there might be some clues in the stories she tells, as you search along the coastal paths for the missing socks.

If you succeed in finding all the socks, you will be a sockdologer – an outstanding person!

Ventnor Fringe 2023 — Sunday 23 July 2023, 5:00pm - 6.00pm

Tickets were priced: *£8, Under 25 £5, Culture / Unlimited Pass 2for1*

__Whatever the streaming services try to tell you, the best stories, and the best storytelling, are NOT best told through a screen...__

The best stories are the stories that just kept on, and keep on, being told, somewherever, and somewhenever, for generations. And the best way to experience them is the original way - from a storyteller. Traditional stories, traditionally told, but still as colourful and vibrant, and entertaining as ever they were. Every so often, some of them disappear from view, but then they make a return, and re-enter the storytelling tradition they never really left...

So make yourself comfortable, and journey to the land of once upon a time, where tales are told that aren't (just) for children. Come and hear island based storyteller [Tony "Monty" Hirst](https://tistales.org.uk/about/monty/) tell of how two farmers tried to get the better of their neighbour, whilst a young prince accepted a challenge to win a beautiful princess. A dragon-serpent watches on as a childless old couple suddenly find they have a child to bring up, a blacksmith does a deal with a devil, and young man certainly knows how to use his head.

What could possibly go wrong...?
