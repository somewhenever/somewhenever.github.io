<h4>DANIEL MORDEN — DARK TALES OF THE WOODS — CANCELLED DUE TO ILLNESS. REPLACEMENT SHOW (SAME TIME, SAME PLACE): XANTHE GRESHAM_KNIGHT — BAG OF WONDERS</h4>

Date: Wednesday 26th July 5-6pm  
Venue: Boniface Studios (The Hall)  

__Storytelling that’s as sharp as a lemon and as sweet as a nut. Accept it or not, we’re all hooked on our baggage system...

...whether it’s a clutch bag or a holdall. But forget what’s in yours, and come and rummage around in Xanthe’s bottomless bag. Between the kitchen sink and the old tube tickets lies a pick and mix of marvels, fibs and fables.

Featuring audience prompted stories accompanied by great accordion playing, performer Xanthe Gresham-Knight is hot footing it down from international storytelling festival, Festival at the Edge, to Ventnor, to present storytelling in its liveliest and most interactive form. So come and see what you can pull from this lucky dip!

As presented at the Soho Theatre and Literature Festivals throughout the UK, Europe and New Zealand.

"An audible feast!" *Gulf News, Waiheke Island New Zealand*

"The Island story-loving audience - and anyone story-curious - is going to LOVE Xanthe’s repertoire of stories and her playful, connected style of telling and her verbal ingenuity!" *Nell Phoenix, Somewhen Storytelling Festival, 2023, headliner*

<div style="text-align: center;"><h3><a href="https://vfringe.co.uk/events/here-be-giants/">'TIS TALES — HERE BE GIANTS</a></h3>
</div>

Friday 28 July 2023, 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm  
Ventnor Arts Club  
Tickets: [£8, Under 25 £5, Culture / Unlimited Pass 2for1](https://vfringe.co.uk/events/here-be-giants/)  

The three Island storytellers, Holly Medland, Monty (Tony) Hirst and Sue Bailey, that comprise [*'Tis Tales*](https://tistales.org.uk/), tell larger than life stories about larger than life characters.

Trolls, ogres, giants and gargantuan monsters, – all have a nightmarish place in the human psyche. Come and hear how the mighty are overcome in tales, of foolishness and bravery, from near and far flung lands.

The storytelling trio’s success at last year’s Fringe helped kick start the Isle of Wight’s very own Somewhen Storytelling Festival, which took place in June this year.

Don’t miss their fresh and enthusiastic renditions of these tales. The stories may have been first told once upon a somewhenever, somewherever, a very long time ago… but be assured , these tales will stay with you long after the last word is spoken.

Sunday 23 July 2023, 5:00pm - 6.00pm  
Boniface Studios (The Hall)  
Tickets: [£8, Under 25 £5, Culture / Unlimited Pass 2for1](https://thelittleboxoffice.com/ventnorexchange/event/view/181093)

__Whatever the streaming services try to tell you, the best stories, and the best storytelling, are NOT best told through a screen...__

The best stories are the stories that just kept on, and keep on, being told, somewherever, and somewhenever, for generations. And the best way to experience them is the original way - from a storyteller. Traditional stories, traditionally told, but still as colourful and vibrant, and entertaining as ever they were. Every so often, some of them disappear from view, but then they make a return, and re-enter the storytelling tradition they never really left...

So make yourself comfortable, and journey to the land of once upon a time, where tales are told that aren't (just) for children. Come and hear island based storyteller [Tony "Monty" Hirst](https://tistales.org.uk/about/monty/) tell of how two farmers tried to get the better of their neighbour, whilst a young prince accepted a challenge to win a beautiful princess. A dragon-serpent watches on as a childless old couple suddenly find they have a child to bring up, a blacksmith does a deal with a devil, and young man certainly knows how to use his head.

What could possibly go wrong...?

<div style="text-align: center;"><h3><a href="https://vfringe.co.uk/events/green/">ISLAND STORYTELLERS — GREEN</a></h3>
</div>

Date / time: Wednesday 26 July 2023, 7:30 pm - 9:30 pm  
Ventnor Library  

GREEN is life itself. From the smallest flower to the oldest oak; flashing eyes of love to the dark plots of jealous envy; ‘The force through the green fuse drives the flower...’. And don’t forget lizards, parrots and dragons with their GREEN Scales and Tails. Come to hear GREEN stories of every description as told by the Island Storytellers.

The simple art of storytelling has been with us forever, enjoyed by young and old alike, in all parts of the world. Come join us to hear a mix of tales linked together by the colour green, and brought to you by The Island Storytellers, a group of people who meet monthly, keen to keep alive the age old art of oral storytelling and share the pleasure of listening and telling.

This evening of tales will be great for adults and older children. A cosy atmosphere with (green!) refreshments in the break.

*Storytelling as living oral culture. Tales for all ages, spoken not read. Because stories aren’t (just) for children.*

How many odd socks are there in your house? In Sue-the-storyteller’s house there seem to be dozens. She’s on the hunt for some pairs.

Can you help her find them?

You’ll need sharp eyes and keen ears as there might be some clues in the stories she tells, as you search along the coastal paths for the missing socks.

If you succeed in finding all the socks, you will be a sockdologer – an outstanding person!
